# tuberculosis-python-final
Hemi and Audrey
Our project will use user input to prescribe the user with tuberculosis treatment/vaccine and provide them with a nearby hospital. We will include a histogram of the average number of hospital beds for the hospitals in the city and a map presenting the location of the cities in the hospital database of Florida and show color the points in a gradient depending on the average gross patient revenue.
